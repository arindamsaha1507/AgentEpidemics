    struct Agent

Represents an agent in the simulation with a unique ID, health state, location, and contacts.

# Fields
- `id`: The unique identifier for the agent.
- `health`: The health state of the agent, which can be `'S'` (Susceptible), `'I'` (Infected), `'E'` (Exposed), or `'R'` (Recovered).
- `location`: A tuple representing the (x, y) coordinates of the agent in the simulation area.
- `contacts`: A vector of agent IDs that this agent has come into contact with.
- `speed`: A floating-point value representing the agent's speed in the simulation.
